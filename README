The project is a comparative analysis between 
Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) and Rapidly Exploring 
Random Trees (RRT) for the puma 560 robot.

Requirements:
1. Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox
Steps: Open http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox
and download RTB 9.10. Unzip the contents, Open rvctools and 
run the startup_rvc.m program.
2. Matlab_R2017b

Instructions for running the program:
1. Clone the repository and unzip all files.
2. Run startup_rvc.m by downloading the Robotics toolbox as 
per above instructions. 
3. From this projet, Open projectStartup.m and run it as 
(projectStartup(50,10)). This will run the PRM program 
for the given workspace. Once the program finishes, one 
can see the trajectory of the robot in moving from start
to goal configurations in the accompanying plot. 
4. To run RRT, in the projectStartup file,
comment out the following lines : 41-42,48-64,66.
Uncomment the following lines: 43-44,73.
5. Run the program as in 3.
This will replace the call to PRM with RRT and the robot 
will do motion planning with RRT algorithm.
